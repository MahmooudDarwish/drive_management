A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Drive Management Project (Mobile Application) without Firebase

Implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication to enable users to log in securely with their Google accounts.
Utilized Google API for seamless integration with Google Drive.
Done using Google Console API 

File Operations:

File Retrieval: Developed functionality to list and display files on the user's Google Drive.
Deletion: Enabled users to delete unwanted files directly from the application.
Download: Implemented a feature for users to download files from their Google Drive through the web interface.
Upload: Facilitated file uploads, allowing users to add new files to their Google Drive effortlessly.

User-Friendly Interface:

Designed an intuitive and responsive user interface for optimal user experience.
Implemented clear navigation and visual cues to enhance usability.
